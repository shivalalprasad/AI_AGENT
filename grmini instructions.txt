The error message you're receiving, `[404 Not Found] models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1, or is not supported for generateContent. Call ListModels to see the list of available models and their supported methods. Sorry, the AI service is currently unavailable or quota exceeded.`, points to two primary issues:

1.  **Incorrect Model Name/Version:** The model `gemini-pro` is likely deprecated, renamed, or not available for the `v1` API version for the `generateContent` method. Google frequently updates and refines its models, and older aliases or preview names can become unsupported.
2.  **Service Unavailable or Quota Exceeded:** This is a secondary message indicating that even if the model name were correct, there might be a problem with your API access, either due to service availability or hitting your usage limits.

Here's how to address both in your JavaScript code:

**The Core Fix: Using `ListModels` and Updating Model Name**

The most reliable way to fix the `404 Not Found` error is to programmatically find the correct, currently supported model names using `genAI.listModels()` and then use one of those names in your `generateContent` calls.

Here's an updated JavaScript example to guide you, incorporating the latest best practices and common model names:

```javascript
const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require("@google/generative-ai");

// IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual API key.
// For production, consider using environment variables to keep your API key secure.
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";

async function chatWithGemini() {
  const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(API_KEY);

  let modelToUse = "";

  try {
    console.log("Listing available Gemini models...");
    const { models } = await genAI.listModels();

    let foundPro = false;
    let foundFlash = false;

    for (const model of models) {
      if (model.supportedMethods.includes("generateContent")) {
        console.log(`Found supported model: ${model.name} (Display Name: ${model.displayName || 'N/A'})`);
        if (model.name.includes("gemini-1.5-pro") && !foundPro) {
          modelToUse = model.name; // Prioritize Gemini 1.5 Pro
          foundPro = true;
        } else if (model.name.includes("gemini-1.5-flash") && !foundFlash && !foundPro) {
          // Use Flash if Pro isn't the first found, or if Pro wasn't found at all yet
          modelToUse = model.name;
          foundFlash = true;
        } else if (!modelToUse && model.name.includes("gemini")) {
          // As a last resort, pick any gemini model if no 1.5-pro or 1.5-flash found yet
          modelToUse = model.name;
        }
      }
    }

    if (!modelToUse) {
      console.error("\nError: No suitable Gemini model found that supports 'generateContent'.");
      console.error("Please ensure your API key is valid, billing is enabled, and there are models available for your region.");
      return;
    }

    console.log(`\nAttempting to use model: ${modelToUse}`);
    const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: modelToUse });

    // Make the content generation request
    const prompt = "What are the benefits of using AI in education?";
    const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
    const response = await result.response;
    const text = response.text();

    console.log("\n--- Successful AI Response ---");
    console.log(text);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("\n--- An Error Occurred ---");
    console.error(`Error details: ${error.message}`);

    if (error.message.includes("404 Not Found")) {
      console.error("Reason: The model you tried to use was not found or is deprecated.");
      console.error("Action: The script attempted to find a working model. Please review the 'Found supported model' list above and ensure your code is using one of them.");
    } else if (error.message.includes("quota exceeded")) {
      console.error("Reason: You have exceeded your API usage limits.");
      console.error("Action: Check your Google Cloud project's quotas and billing status. You might need to enable billing or request a quota increase.");
    } else if (error.message.includes("403")) {
        console.error("Reason: Permission denied. Your API key might be incorrect or lacks necessary permissions.");
        console.error("Action: Double-check your API key and ensure it's properly configured in your Google Cloud project.");
    } else {
      console.error("Reason: An unexpected API error occurred.");
      console.error("Action: Check your network connection, API key, and refer to Google's official Gemini API documentation for troubleshooting specific error codes.");
    }
  }
}

// Call the function to start the process
chatWithGemini();
```

**Steps to Run and Troubleshoot:**

1.  **Install the SDK:** If you haven't already, install the Google Generative AI JavaScript SDK:
    ```bash
    npm install @google/generative-ai
    ```
2.  **Save the Code:** Save the code above as a `.js` file (e.g., `gemini_chat.js`).
3.  **Replace `YOUR_API_KEY`:** **Crucially**, replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Gemini API key.
      * **Security Note:** For production applications, never hardcode your API key directly in your code. Use environment variables (e.g., `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`) and load them securely.
4.  **Run from Terminal:** Execute the script using Node.js:
    ```bash
    node gemini_chat.js
    ```

**Explanation of the Fixes:**

  * **`genAI.listModels()`:** This is the key to resolving the `404 Not Found` for the model. It fetches a list of all models currently available to your API key.
  * **Model Iteration and Selection:** The code iterates through the `models` list.
      * It specifically checks `model.supportedMethods.includes("generateContent")` to ensure the model can be used for text generation.
      * It prioritizes `gemini-1.5-pro` (or similar stable 'pro' versions) and then `gemini-1.5-flash` (or similar 'flash' versions) as these are generally the recommended general-purpose models.
      * If no specific `1.5-pro` or `1.5-flash` is found, it falls back to any model containing "gemini".
  * **Dynamic Model Usage:** Once a suitable `modelToUse` is identified, it's used to initialize `genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: modelToUse })`. This ensures you're always using a model that your API key currently has access to.
  * **Quota Exceeded/Service Unavailable Handling:**
      * The `try...catch` block specifically checks for messages like "quota exceeded".
      * **Actionable Advice:** If you hit a `quota exceeded` error:
          * **Check your Google Cloud Project:** Go to the Google Cloud Console for the project associated with your API key.
          * **Enable Billing:** Ensure that billing is enabled for your project. Many Gemini models require a linked billing account even for free-tier usage, or for higher tiers.
          * **Review Quotas:** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "IAM & Admin" \> "Quotas." Search for "Generative Language API" or "Vertex AI Generative AI" quotas. You might be hitting limits on "requests per minute," "tokens per minute," or "requests per day." You may need to request an increase if your usage is legitimate and higher than the free tier allows.
          * **Rate Limits:** Google's APIs have rate limits to prevent abuse. If you're making many requests in a short period, you might temporarily hit these. Implement exponential backoff in your application if you're making frequent calls.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the correct Gemini model to use and address any API access or quota issues.
